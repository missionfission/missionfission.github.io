Expressing Objects just like Words: Recurrent Visual Embedding for Image-Text Matching : Multi-attention Cross Matching Model - Dual Path Recurrent Neural Network (DP-RNN) to compute similarity
Density Matching for Bilingual Word Embedding. NAACL 2019. [PDF]
: proposes an approach that instead expresses the two monolingual embedding spaces as probability densities defined by a Gaussian mixture model, and matches the two densities using a method called normalizing flow.

## Causal Machine Learning

## Story Generation Platforms
