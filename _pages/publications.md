## Power efficient photonic network-on-chip for a scalable GPU

Published at the **IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip, New York, 2019 (Lightning Talk).**

Author : Janibul Bashir, **Khushal Sethi**, Smruti Sarangi

[**Paper**](), [**Code**](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/tejas/gputejas/index.html)

**Patent Application : “A GRAPHICS PROCESSOR UNIT (GPU) SYSTEM WITH PHOTONICS BASED ON-CHIP NETWORK”**, Indian Ordinary Patent Application No. 201911047168,

Authors : Smruti Ranjan Sarangi, Janib Nanda, **Khushal Sethi**

Built the [**GPUTejas v1.1**](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/tejas/gputejas/index.html) : Parallel GPU Architectural Simulator in Java for NVIDIA’s Pascal Micro-Architecture by the usage of Ocelot CUDA Emulator (PTX on x86). Added functionalities for Electrical and Optical Network on Chip (NOC), DRAM, Memory Hierarchy, Operand Collector based Register-Files, 3-Stage SIMT Pipeline, GPU Power Model. Verified Timing and Power Modules using Micro-Benchmarking for GTX1080Ti.

Work done in the SRISHTI Research Group (May'18-July'19) with Prof. Smruti Ranjan Sarangi
