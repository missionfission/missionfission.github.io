One thing, that I have found in my life is that going out of the way to do things usually helps, being a bit of humble, having a higher resilience, having a bit more risk, working a bit harder. So, that you can try and push the boundaries of your achievement further and further.
Now, it is quite debatable on how much that helps, and how much is just luck and genetics+previlige, but I think it has been important because that is what is meant by free will. If you always stick in your zone, then there is really low chance that you will get really ahead of others.
Sometimes it was strange and unnecessary and harmful too. But I think that there has been some gain due to it. Not settling for less really helps.
Because otherwise my achievements too would be around the mean case only.
I want to perform really really better than the mean case of the Nature-Nurture Matrix, that is why I try to become a daredevil
The question that I keep asking myself, because things have gone back and forth at times, is that is there a limit to how much better I can do
And this going back and forth thing is the most strange part. Because then the doubt emerges, am I really doing better than the mean? : This is the most difficult question of my life
