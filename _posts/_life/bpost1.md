# Hire from Velocity, Acceleration and Experience

# What is a simple formula of hiring smart people

The reason for this view can be the fact that a very tiny percentage of the
human population (mainly consisting of scientists and engineers) are
thoroughly aware of the bounds of their inventions. For the general public,
lack of the knowledge in its functioning is what causes fear and critique.
Identify and elaborate the significant patterns of ethical argumentation in NEST
ethic
There are basically four patterns in ethical argumentation :
Consequentialist Arguments
The consequentialist argument is based on the utilitarian philosophy, i.e.
maximizing the collective happiness of all people.
These arguments say that technology makes the world a better place, humans
have been progressing for so long, even though in the development period there
can be small mishaps, that should not force us to become risk-averse in
development and we should not try to stifle innovation by adding bureaucratic
regulations.
Deontological Arguments
Deontological arguments derive their substance from principles that are agreed
upon for every human being, the basic human rights, equality, the right to live,
the right to choose, freedom of thought and right to information.
These arguments say that no matter how great the utilitarian benefits of a
technology are, there are certain human rights that need to be preserved.
This means that a human should not be forced to forgo his autonomy and privacy
on a new technology because it makes us well off in the long run.
Embryonic gene editing is one such example, where if a person can pay to get a
fancy baby, then other people will be forced to make the same choice, because
otherwise their children don’t have a competing chance in life with the genetically
enhanced ones.
Justice Arguments
The justice arguments say that the impact of technology should be equal to
everyone and only the rich should not be the ones to benefit from it.
Although it is true that technology makes the pie bigger for everyone, and even
the poor and use its benefits, but in the immediate sense i.e. in its development it
is only the rich and upper middle-class families who have the resources to gain
larger portions of benefit from it.
The benefits of starting a company to gain from high capitals, is the privilege of
the upper middle class families with good educational backgrounds. The
downstream benefits to the poor happen after a long period of time. This is also
true across the globe where developed countries benefit more from these
progress early on than developing countries, hence always remain ahead in the
game.
A practical example of this is the CAR T-Cell therapies who have saved the lives
of many people in the west from late-stage cancer, as they are lucky to get into
clinical trials. On the other hand, late-stage cancers in most developing countries
are a death sentence and it would be at least half a decade or a decade before
this treatment is in universal access of everyone on earth.
Arguments from ‘Good Life’ Ethics
Good life ethics point to the good life that can be achieved from the progress of
emerging technologies. Today scientists are taking on bold challenges, such as
reversing aging, and most experts say that one of the people alive today may live
up to 200 years from the rapid progress in the field.
Even though new technological progress has caused several other problems
such as anxiety, depression, autoimmune diseases and maybe stress, progress
is made on all fronts, even in minimizing the bad effects of the technology on our
body.
The critics of technology, choose a different stance where they give an outline of
a good life, which may include sustainability by living in harmony with the
environment and promoting a minimalist attitude of technological use.
My take on this is that technological progress is beneficial in the long run.
Technology is not a neutral force, it makes the world a better place, if the right
intentions are kept in mind by the creators.
As of 2020, we can surely see the result of creating unnecessary regulations in
drug trials and gene therapies. Due to small mishaps that happened, bureaucratic
organizations became really critical without actually understanding the great
promise of these new inventions. As the world fights with coronavirus, scientists
have no other option than to repurpose existing drugs in therapeutics, a vaccine
still looks a minimum of 18 months away.
If appropriately the research had been funded, the innovation encouraged that
being regulated, today we would have been in a better situation. Part of the
reason this is because the media, politicians and critics take the things out of
context and try to portray a unlikely doomsday scenario for these technologies.
Such fear sells easily to the ignorant public.
The adoption of technology is incredibly hard, and requires perseverance,
ingenuity and courage of the best minds on earth to solve the problems in its
practical adoptions. There are no free lunches in research!! Technological
progress has only been possible by the effort of intelligence and dedication of
thousands of researchers who don’t give up on the problem even after failing
several times.
