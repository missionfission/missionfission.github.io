These musings can go on forever, it my absolute passion to think and study human behavior and build world models. So, I sometimes blow up people's mind upto the point where they are almost baffled.

How much should I be helping stupid juniors?, Is there a way to make them smart or they are just gonna remain stupid
More specifically, at what point do people become smarter, what words specifically need to be said to make them smarter. Or becoming smarter is related to their philosophy and personality.
Our brain is not designed for learning the complex stuff such as maths, coding etc
Does having a reward mechanism such as in academia help it train, force it do things that people won't do in their comfort zone.
Sometimes you have to artificially exaggerate things, give emphasis and attention to things, so that brain produces networks for corrections and learning
Does having a lot of choices and loneliness, can actually work then, how is it forcing the brain to train?
The further important question is if after a point the reducing number of neurons in brain, prevent fast learning
What is the reward system you build for learning then
If I get the answer to the question : how hard is it really to raise money ?, then we know what to focus on more
It is just so hard to tell, if the persuasion works with importance, higher feedback in the brain or being non-chalant which allows the person to have a even higher feedback if they pay attention.
I think importance increases attention enough to allow faster error corrections, in the brain. This allows people to choose reach the correct point ...
Most of the time the person is just making stuff up, he is trying to connect with people at their mentality, if you are too much smart they will label you as crazy. People went in the first place to get a shoulder, so take they are more open, paying more attention, opening up the plasticity, hence driving higher feedback : which converts them into devotee, not critically questioning everything.

So, how do you remain both critical and respectful at the same time, so that it doesn't piss off the other person.
Understand their philosophy, what do they really want. And are their actions, firmly based on that or do they have ulterior motives also
Cause they may be smarter than you, they will tell u something but you don't hv the intelligence/information enough to appreciate it.
