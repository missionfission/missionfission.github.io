I am living, like most other people do, who want to be successful in a opportunity-observation + result-opportunity translation + active-decision making + philosophy based maximization perspective.

Now, what I have to do is to take that and move to an impact expectation-maximization perspective, instead of looking at observations and taking actions that will maximize future results, (if in my capability), I want to actively generate plans for maximization of my future impact.
