The purpose of human civilization is to find the answers to every question possible and explain every data, behavior and give sense to every action in the world.
We answer the easier questions first and then the harder questions.
The human society is one of the most determining factors in our progress.
The human brains in cooperation have done marvels and helped us explore, invent and discover the subjects of science, mathematics etc.

The progress has slowed down due to a lack of money in some sections. It has created inequality and loss of human potential.
Illusions and Attachments- Another big reason for the problems is attachments to objects irrelevant.The more the attachment the more problems. So, we must reduce our
illogical attachments to materialistic things. This possible if are more connected to everybody in human civilization.
Addictions - The fundamental nature of human growth is to learn from our mistakes. However, if we addicted to substance we keep doing things again and again.
Addiction changes our brain, the CPU of our body.

We need to change our education system, healthcare, work, market, family and lifestyle to keep in pace with it.
But the problem arises when we assume the government of elected individuals with no legal requirement of scientific background to be allowed to make laws to update our society with time. This lack of such mechanisms or individuals for enforcing causes us to fear for a dystopian future.
Because science is what is real and it is what drives society in the first place. Science brings us closer, Our boundaries drive us apart.

In my opinion, every individual is capable of giving an excellent contribution to the society.
But the current pipeline selectively chooses individuals best at each stage and leaves out the others.
Instead of building boundaries if our govt. focus on developing resources for forming such a pipeline the world will be better-of.
In a democracy in lower educated countries, the ignorant people elect ignorant representatives who do not lead them to progress and keep them ignorant.
This cycle results in an evergoing loop. It las led to corruption, poverty and other major problems.
The work for the welfare of humanity at its best requires constant updates by experts in various fields.
When the ignorance is lifted then there would be prosperity.
There is a current need that we make full-fledged pipelines available to people from birth to death.
The goal is to make a pipeline of the current structure of the goals of human civilization and simultaneously integrate the process of education for making us a
better-person with providing useful work.

What I propose is restructure our society to a science-based society

So the future progress will only increase if our generations become better and better.
A perfect society of exponential growth involves free market, no taxes, no duties, etc
education, healthcare is totally free or at bare minimum money.
