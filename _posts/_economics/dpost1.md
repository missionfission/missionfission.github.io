# How Twitter is Destroying the Indian Democracy

Even the smartest people in our society are influenced by the social media. Fake twitter trends has been a thing for quite a while now.

The problem is so severe today, that these fake twitter trends has manipulated top journalists and media, along with the public into beleiving something that is not true.

The journalists would rather sit in their office and monitor trends on twitter to have their opinion on a subject, rather than going on ground and doing the investigation. The timeline of such acts in nearly clear.

The independence of Indian Media is vanishing because most journalists are afraid of the public opinion, they show and mold their opinions to discuss issues that would give them a higher TRP. The only problem is they are estimating public opinion of country with 900 million voting population from fake twitter trends created by employing few 100 people. Obviously, this has been happening insidiously for many years, through various mediums including fake Whatsapp Forwards, Jokes, Nationalist Songs and Praising of the Indian Army.

A large number of people still tune to the traditional media for their news, then the biases start showing up . People beleiving or not have started sympathizing with the wrong things.

Nearly all the twitter trends in India are fake, but most journalists are obviously so stupid that they believe them or have been forced by their employers or . The effect soon started appearing in the reporting, the questions they ask. This has led most people in India into a state of Pluralistic Ignorance.

A Functional Democracy requires smart people, people who can think critically and logically, who can understand others argument and also come up with arguments themselves, are not easily gullible and . But, one hand most of the Indian Population can today read, understand the arguments that others provide but would not be able to come up with counter-arguments themselves.

The dangerous part is that opposition to current regime is astonishingly weak, with no head to lead any actions against.

People are just not smart to understand when they are being manipulated. This is partly because the entire educational system in India is utterly broken. Further, the use of social media is considerably growing given that the mobile data prices in our country are lowest in the World.
Obviously, when citizens in some of the wealthiest countries like the United States can be manipulated by Social Media, how hard was it actually supposed to be in India.

Think of it as fox news, expect every major news channel in India is trying to become Fox News to gain TRP, sympathy of the ruling party and enjoying luxury in their cozy offices. The trolling of oppposition leaders is so common and widespread, the arguments of Whataboutism so common, distribution channels of fake news so widespread.

Things as simple as memes can be manipulated into political purposes.

A lot of things went wrong by which India has reached this state, a lot of things have to go right . Start growing a spine, start writing things unthinkable.

The hive mind of the BJP IT Cell is practically running a country with 1.3 billion people, an annual budget of 300 billion dollars and 2 million army personnels and nearly 150 nuclear warheads!!

Even till today, one of the biggest english news channels watched in India, Republic TV is also the biggest distributor of fake news.

The times are sad, the fascists are extremely clever and resolute, who are willing to let go of anything to further their agenda, they are using human lives are used as pawns. The progressives gullible, scared and amiable. The opposition divided and unable to stand.

Even though, arguments can be given that . Nearly 6 years of propaganda, can change anyones mind. Every institution has been infiltrated by explicit and implicit actions, the judiciary passes judgements in favor. Then claim as if institution has ordered it so it needs to be executed.

Timeline of delhi protests and the "Chronology" Stands clear,

Companies like Twitter and Facebook can utilize their platforms to remove hate speech, decrease trolling, detect fake twitter trends. They need to do more. Its not that hard either, .

Musings from BJP's Chronology

This is not a joke, lives and future of a lot of people depend on them. Its incredibly depressing to tell doing business to make the world a better place, involves active effort not passive actions due to regulation.
