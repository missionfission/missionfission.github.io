We are in the midst of a great economic change in our society. After several decades of economy growing in countries such as China and USA, the economies are expected to shrink this year. Further, given the number of unprecendent job losses and complete halt of economic activity will require major policy decisions from various leaders.

In the past 2 weeks alone millions of people have enrolled for the unemployment benefits in the United States. Obviously for bigger countries such as india, the numbers maybe harder to track , but will be much greater given the current scenarios. There has been a unprecendented stock market collapse of various nations despite many pronounced federal policies which may supposedly work.

These times have forced me to think the economy and society we have built from first principles. In 1930s, great proposals for economic upliftment were proposed, most of them now vanished, were worth pondering upon.

As radical proposals only get adopted in radical times, this series of posts tries to work a better society and economy of a utopian nature from the first principles. Even though, economics is now a much more advanced field than it was in 1930s, most economists today refrain from publishing only truly radical ideas, because even the acceptance of not-so-radical ideas such as UBI have faced severe difficulties in societal acceptance and adoption.

The political discourse has allowed the conservation to be just cemented between the capitalist vs communist definitions of a socioeconomic system. Thinking in narrow terms of these definitions, hides the purpose of what it means to be a society, why do we need socioeconomic systems and how these systems will always fail if people go beyond the context of their intended purpose and start damaging us.

Obviously, the 2019 US primary elections has made the idea of UBI much more popular thanks to Andrew Yang, the socioeconomic systems are still hardly above their worst performing nature.

As a true optimist, the question I keep asking myself are :
How fast will be the societal progress if all decisions were made from first principles ?

What are the fundamental limits on socioeconomic progress ?

I tackle these questions in a series of blog posts below starting from the first principles :
