Although the post is titled first principles, these principles aren't derived from economics, but are the principles of our collective philosophy.
How should be go about thinking for these first principles can be a discussion of real importance, but this discussion of philosophy is left for another post.

Taking as a baseline, the human rights and altruistic principles of society and human cooperation to maximize utilitarian good in the society, the perspective gives some notion of how the society can and should run.

Here is the assumption made is that we can believe the human ingenuity, scientific research and technological innovations as the fundamental value creators of the society and the creating a better society definitely innolves the acceleration of these value creators.

# Money is only a symbolic form which human governance can manipulate in any form possible :

Although this statement seems in itself as a radical idea, it is critical to understand that
The ideas published in a post titled : Free Money for Social Progress by Jerome Blanc.

The real money that flows in the society is the money that causes everyday consumption and control of :
The money rested in form of stocks, carries power and privilege, more like a heightened position in the society. And as long the money is in the palm of right hands, it is safe to asssume that it can be used in a very productive way.

Hence, if a extremely smart person who takes all the right policy decisions in a society : How can the socioeconomic progress can be accelerated as a result ?
In other words tos say, is what is the cost of governance stupidity ?. How much do we suffer from putting stupid people in governance ? what are the downstream dangers of stupid public policy decisions on our country ?

As of 2020, the notion of the role of governance seems more powerful than others

Should billionaires Exist ? What is the inheritance of money related to ?

# What does Governance Mean for modern society ?

Balancing Negative Externalities and Providing Justice to People one of the first jobs,
Protecting the citizens
and Uplifting the Economy
Techonological Innonvations should be discounted upto the point where they can be adopted by everyone to allow distributive justice
We have to take everyone together in this journey

# Proofs and context cannot be skipped in a Networked Intelligence Society

The fundamental goal would be to not just tie the principles derived and discussed for a discussion of economics but to give a pathway on how to reach there ?
What are the important public policy decisions and technological guided societal, governance and cultural change that will help us reach there ?

# Discussions of Interest Rates and Money Hoarding

# The value of Money which allows more lavish consumption is not seen as optimal compared to the one which allows more influence and power :

# Let us take everything we know about the study of economy and try to work out things again from the first principles :

The economics of today require a more confounded discussion by loosening up the assumptions of our current society, and imagining a more progressive version.
This excercise is definitely going to allow us gain more insights in th money and society and collective human behaviour and answer some of the esoteric phenomena of our society.
Although we will refer to the studies in economics from time to time : to utilise the models that are built and evidence collected, the vision of obtaining a new better world is more important today, where there is no0 dearth of important problems to be solved. Athough what is the definition of important problems require a more profound and sophisticated explanation.

Gates is right, in a way: Economists don’t understand much about the macroeconomy. No one does. Any responsible economist is the first to admit that.

Natural rate of unemployment: the idea, believed by many economists and policymakers, that there is a rate at which unemployment could get so low that it could trigger ever-rising inflation.

It’s an idea that has governed decades of monetary policymaking, often prompting the Fed to keep interest rates higher than it should — slowing down the economy in the process — out of fear of accelerating inflation. Ocasio-Cortez didn’t waste time poking holes at it. She pointed out that the unemployment rate, now 3.7 percent, has fallen well below the Fed’s estimates of the natural rate, which it forecast at 5.4 percent in 2014 and 4.2 percent today. And yet, she noted, “inflation is no higher today than it was five years ago. Given these facts, do you think it’s possible that the Fed’s estimates of the lowest sustainable unemployment rate may have been too high?”

The natural rate of unemployment that AOC questioned is one such idea (more on that below). There are three others worth singling out:

Globalization is a win-win proposition for all, an idea that has deservedly taken a battering in recent years;
Federal budget deficits “crowd out” private investments; and that the minimum wage will only have negative effects on jobs and workers.
Economists and policymakers have gotten these ideas wrong for decades, at great cost to the public. Especially hard hit have been the most economically vulnerable, and these mistakes can certainly be blamed for the rise of inequality. It’s time we moved on from them.

1. Going below the natural rate of unemployment could spark an inflationary spiral The mandate of the Federal Reserve is to achieve maximum employment at stable prices. It has interpreted the latter to mean an inflation rate of 2 percent. For decades, the Fed has used the benchmark interest rate it controls to target that inflation rate, and it’s done so by trying to keep actual unemployment close to its estimate of what’s called the natural rate of unemployment — a rate below which it was believed inflation would spiral up.

The problem is that the core relationship behind this model — the negative correlation between unemployment and inflation — has been weakening for years, and with it any ability to reliably estimate the natural unemployment rate. Moreover, as Powell acknowledged, there’s been an asymmetry: Because the estimates of the natural rate have been too high, the Fed has often intervened in the direction of raising or failing to cut interest rates.

The cost of this asymmetry has been steep. Since 2009, the average of the Fed’s natural rate estimate has been about 5 percent. As Powell stressed, we can’t accurately identify the natural rate of unemployment, but suppose it’s actually 3.5 percent. Targeting 5 percent unemployment when we could achieve 3.5 percent with little risk of spiraling inflation would mean 2.4 million people unnecessarily out of work. Even targeting the Fed’s current natural rate (4.2 percent) would sacrifice a million potential workers to the altar of an empirically elusive concept.

And the unemployed are just one subgroup that gets hurt in such a scenario. Much research has shown that in slack labor markets, middle- and low-wage earners lack the bargaining clout they have in tight labor markets. As such, they face lower pay, fewer hours of work, higher poverty, and wider racial economic gaps.

By contrast, high-income households are little affected — which means that labor market slack can deepen inequality. The figure below, from a recent paper by Keith Bentele and me, shows the acceleration — the difference between wage growth in strong versus weak labor markets — for real annual earnings.

For low-income workers, we found earnings rose at about a 2 percent annual pace in hot labor markets and fell at about a 4 percent pace in cool ones (the difference, 6 percent, is the first bar). Clearly, the benefits of moving from slack to taut conditions are much more important for low- than for high-earning households.

Such are the costs of over-estimating the natural rate.

2. Everybody wins with globalization
   Back in the 1990s, when the Clinton administration was trying to sell NAFTA, the view that expanded trade was virtually all upside began to pervade the rhetoric and politics of both parties. They were supported by economic arguments that exporting industries would expand into markets and add new jobs, and consumers would have cheaper goods. By dint of their superior productivity, US manufacturers and their communities wouldn’t be hurt. Any disruption to workers’ livelihoods was either dismissed as an impossibility or placed under the antiseptic rubric of “transition costs.”

This excerpt from the 1994 economic report of the president nicely captures the zeitgeist:

As economists have long predicted, freer trade has been a win-win strategy for both the United States and its trading partners, allowing all to reap the benefits of enhanced specialization, lower costs, greater choice, and an improved international climate for investment and innovation. American industries—both their workers and their owners—have benefited from increased export markets and from cheaper imported inputs. American consumers have been able to purchase a wider variety of products at lower prices than they could have without the expansion of trade.

When pressed as to how expanded trade could truly be “win-win,” advocates like Clinton’s economics team above cited the economic theory of comparative advantage: When trading partners produce what they’re best at producing, both countries will come out ahead.

But the theory never said expanded trade would be win-win for all. Instead, it (and its more contemporary extensions) explicitly said that expanded trade generates winners and losers, and that the latter would be our blue-collar production workers exposed to international competition. True, the theory maintained (correctly in my view) that the benefits to the winners were large enough to offset the costs to the losers and still come out ahead. But as trade between nations expanded, policymakers quickly forgot about the need to compensate for the losses.

The era of free trade eventually led to large trade deficits with countries with comparatively productive factories to ours but with much lower wages, most notably Mexico and China. As in every other advanced economy, the share of US manufacturing employment had long been drifting down. But the number of US factor jobs held pretty constant around 17 million — until around 2000, when, over the next decade, almost 6 million such jobs were lost. Economists who’ve studied the period now refer to it as “the China Shock.”

Once again, these impacts didn’t just translate into just job losses; wages were hit, too. Between the late 1940s and the late 1970s, when production workers were relatively insulated from foreign competition, blue-collar manufacturing compensation more than doubled. By contrast, it’s grown only 5 percent since then.

Did the winners from trade — the multinational corporations that relocated production, the finance sector that made the deals, the retailers that profited from “the China price” — compensate the losers? Of course not. They argued that “everyday low prices” were reward enough.

But not only did the winners fail to help the losers — say, through serious employment-replacement programs, robust safety net assistance, direct job creation, and investments to make our manufacturers more competitive — they instead used their winnings to invest in politicians to cut their taxes and write ever more trade deals favoring investors over workers.

Let me be very clear. Both the US and developing countries have significantly benefitted from global trade. But because of the demonstrably false view that free trade is all upside — win-win — considerable economic pain has been meted out, pain that has not been met with anything approaching an adequate policy response.

3. Deep budget deficits will crowd out private investment
   For decades, economists argued that when the federal government runs a budget deficit, it pushes up interest rates and slows economic growth. It’s a theory known as “crowd-out,” suggesting government borrowing from a relatively fixed stock of loanable capital crowds out private borrowing, which in turn raises the cost of capital — i.e., the interest rate.

But this is yet another relationship that has failed to hold up, though not before its adherents created considerable hardship, both here and even more so in Europe, through austere budget policy in the wake of the Great Recession. The belief in this idea prompted policymakers to reduce government spending to avoid alleged crowd-out effects well before the private sector had recovered and could generate enough growth on its own.

There were certainly periods in the past when crowd-out did indeed appear in the data. The 1970s and early 1980s saw larger budget deficits (i.e., more negative) and higher interest rates. But since then, deficits have swung significantly up and down while interest rates have consistently drifted down.

Most recently, we’ve been posting very large budget deficits given the state of the economy (due to both deficit-financed tax cuts and spending) and interest rates are nonetheless hitting historic lows — precisely the opposite of crowd-out predictions.

Source: Federal Reserve and Bureau of Economic Analysis
This all sounds pretty abstract, but it has stark implications on the ground. Based on the deeply embedded notion (at the time) that the deficits built up in the Great Recession needed to come down quickly, the federal government pivoted to deficit reduction well before our private sector had recovered.

As a member of the Obama economic team at the time, I can confirm that crowd-out fears were a motivation for the pivot. According to this analysis by the Brooking’s Institute, between 2011 and 2014, fiscal policy cut about 1 percentage point per year from real GDP growth. Based on the historical correlation between growth and jobs, this austerity added 2 points to the unemployment rate in those years, or about 3 million jobs.

I tend not to give Trump a lot of credit for economic policy, and I believe his tax cut will exacerbate inequality and rob the Treasury of needed revenue. But the fiscal economics of Trump’s tax cuts are revealing in ways that relate both to crowd-out and the natural rate of unemployment. As noted, deficits are up and interest rates are down. Meanwhile, the positive fiscal boost has helped drive the unemployment rate down to 50-year lows while inflation remains low and stable. These developments clearly undermine long-held economic doctrines, and they’ve been a boon to working families.

That said, a final point must be underscored: The absence of crowd-out doesn’t mean deficits no longer matter. Even with low rates, we’ll still be devoting more tax revenue to financing our debt, and even more worrisome is the fact that we’re almost certain to enter the next recession with a debt-to-GDP ratio that’s twice that of the historical norm. This will likely lead Congress to be more timid in fighting the next recession. But this is a political constraint, not an economic one.

4. A higher minimum wage will only hurt workers
   Another big mistake with lasting consequences has been the assumption that minimum wage increases will hurt their intended beneficiaries: low-wage workers.

The theory is that free markets set an “equilibrium” wage that perfectly matches supply and demand given employers needs and workers’ capabilities. Force that equilibrium wage up and rampant unemployment will result.

When I was coming up in the profession, our textbooks argued that believing minimum wages could help low-wage workers was akin to believing that water flowed uphill. Their message was particularly comforting to conservative politicians who wanted to protect the profits of employers of low-wage workers.

Today, decades of high-quality research (much of it initiated by the late, great economist Alan Krueger) have introduced a much more nuanced view about the true impacts of minimum-wage hikes. But years of economists’ opposition to the policy have left us with a national minimum wage of \$7.25 per hour, a level far too low to support the many families that depend on the minimum wage. (Another myth was that only teenagers earned the minimum; David Cooper’s work shows the main beneficiaries of higher minimum wages are working adults.)

Economic Policy Institute
How the consensus began to change is instructive. To their credit, some state policymakers decided to ignore the economists and raise minimum wages in their states. This provided researchers like Krueger with quasi-natural experiments of a type too rare in economics. The positive results of these studies led many more states and cities to raise their wage floors (29 states plus DC now have minimums above the federal level), and this fed back into the experimental research, creating a powerful loop.

Summarizing a large and still contentious body of research, a fair conclusion is that, conditional on their magnitude, minimum wage increases accomplish their goal of raising pay for low-wage workers without large job-loss effects. But the broader point is that an economic relationship believed to be steadfast was tested and was found wanting.

The changing consensus can be seen in a new report from the Congressional Budget Office — a bastion of mainstream economics — that found an increase in the minimum wage to $15, phased in by 2025, would benefit 27.3 million workers, with an average gain of $1,500 per year, reduce the number of the poor by 1.3 million, but also cut employment of affected workers by 1.3 million. Yes, some would lose jobs, but so many more would benefit — hardly the “everybody loses” prediction that prevailed among economists for decades.

What all these economic mistakes have in common
Pegging the “natural rate” too high, ignoring the harm from exposure to international competition, austere budget policy, low and stagnant minimum wages — all of these misunderstood economic relationships have one thing in common.

In every case, the costs fall on the vulnerable: people who depend on full employment to get ahead; blue-collar production workers and communities built around factories; families who suffer from austerity-induced weak recoveries and under-funded safety nets, and who depend on a living wage to make ends meet. These groups are the casualties of faulty economics.

In contrast, the benefits in every case accrue to the wealthy: highly educated workers largely insulated from slack labor markets, executives of outsourcing corporations, the beneficiaries of revenue-losing tax cuts that allegedly require austere budgets, and employers of low-wage workers.

In this regard, there is a clear connection between each one of these mistakes and the rise of economic inequality.

I cannot overemphasize the importance of recognizing who benefits and who loses from these economic mistakes, because that difference is why these mistakes persist. Every one of the wrong assumptions described here benefits conservative causes, from reducing the bargaining clout of wage earners, to strengthening the hand of outsourcers and offshorers, to lowering the labor costs of low-wage employers. These economic assumptions are thus complementary to the conservative agenda and that, in and of themselves, makes them far more enduring than they should be based on the facts.

It is no coincidence that the assumptions are being so rigorously questioned by a new group of highly progressive politicians, like Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. They are making the critical connections in our political economy to challenge old assumptions that have hurt working people for too long. The vast majority of us will be better off for their work.
