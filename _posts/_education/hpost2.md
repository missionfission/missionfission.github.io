Generation of Assignments and Quizzes to create a great environment, the real way to accelerate learning is to study and solve problems/assignments together.

Goal Driven Private Research Startups + Private Nonprofit Research Foundations are the future

High expectations and pressure to achieve refer to establishing challenging goals for students" (2003, p. 35). The reverse is also true, in that low expectations and little pressure to achieve cause poor achievement. When teachers present students with low-rigor tasks, they create low achievement even when students do well on these tasks.

When assignments are not taught or are not taught explicitly, students lose out on the academic and intellectual experiences that assignments offer. According to Harvard researchers who have studied classroom dynamics, the "task predicts performance" (City, Elmore, Fieman, & Teitel, 2009, p. 30). If assignments are not of high quality and are not relevant to the curriculum, then learning will also be of low quality and loosely connected to the curriculum, if at all.

Important to overcome the starting fear, to get moving by pushing the brain out of the dormant state, measuring productivity is also important to work and cope with time wastage.

The dominant question of how does specialization help? Solving that assignment actually allows experimentation, allowing to produce deeper insight and philosophy.

After the time when low-hanging fruit of a field ends, the approach for R&D should shift significantly. Chasing a mid-hanging fruit or high fruit may require significant advances to Collaborations, Capital and Innovative push of clear logical reasoning by the top giants.

Physics: Rockets/Space, Optics/Photonics, Curiosity, Mathematics: Nearly None - As a Baseline. Low Practical Fields: Economics (Mostly easy), Law, Finance. CS, AI: Known. EE: Moore and other Trends. Mech: Flying Vehicles, Electric, RPA. Civil: Tools Available, Only good for Megaprojects. EE (Power), Chem Eng: Industrial Processes for Creating (Old Knowledge). BioTech: Same as Bio. Philosophy: Good for a past time. Others are not that impactful.

What is the best content for learning: Presentations, Short Videos, Graphics. How to automate most of that. The resources to look for are resources on presentation, which is converted to good videos (Crash Course, and can it be done for all of the videos available.

add imitation content, watching people how to code. Then doing assignments in a manner that helps them. make practical part worth higher points perhaps.

mobile content has to be different then

How to make notes, maybe reading literature or books, or something not in too much depth, learn coding language et,
Because say we want to learn without a formal system, without tests on our own, from a book then what should be the path to follow
The productivity and efficiency are great up to a point but they also hurt in many ways after a while: increasing anxiety, micro-analysis, too much focus on just productivity, reducing brain space, reducing meta-analysis and creativity, distraction into triviality etc. That's why redundancy is also important
The real unhappiness problem: When you wanna move really fast/be successful, but unable to sacrifice/do hard things - can be due to various reasons

Make decisions in repeated closures or (yes or no) to minimize brain space, because having a nuanced opinion will have more information and hence consume more brain space. That is why people prefer closure. Choose and give them closure.

It is just so important to decouple learning into things such as- understanding blocks/abstractions, memorizing (effectively, in-conservation, memory using logic, explanations/vocabulary), meta-learning methods, logic (encapsulation, logic using memory), complexity (modularity, encapsulation, virtualization, abstraction)

Passion-Societal Value Intersection Diagram, Training your brain - A revolutionary perspective on learning. I am only smart when I am rich.......

We propose Agile Education Technology :
Key Principles : Easy, Cheap and Low End User Compute based Software and Tools should be available to build things
Move fast, Learn Fast, Build things, Improve and Increase Efficiency, Disrupt
Learn in a Teleological Fashion ( Learn as you go)
Achieve Great Milestones
Increase Velocity

Intergenerational Education Mobility
Parent Trap
If you can design an innovative foolproof system, in just one generation we will rise to the top
Collaboration System in Science : Define roles, outcomes, open acknowledge shortcomings in collaboration
UX Design like Google
Vertical Integration become important to get a net highly +ve intergenerational education mobility
A Portion of Professionals who have plasticity on what they want to do, but most have become static after say age above 27.
I. E. They are not going back to school/study. So, the point now becomes to passively influence them by other media to create that intergenerational shift.
Then create a culture of empathy that allows children to be way more smarter than their parents, in a way that they choose right decisions for themselves and their family welfare without a huge rift. That culture and understanding needs to be propagated fast.
And curriculum designed should be aware of such things
School-University leak reduces the economic mobility significantly
Have those big ambitions from the start that let you get out of the parent trap.
roblem is incredibly hard to solve, involve a mixture of approaches to work upon, including various techniques at different levels to create that impact.

When you are disseminating information to students, it should be done in the lowest entropy way possible
i.e. the words said should encode maximum information (articulation), optimal coding (at maximum channel capacity.
Little Room for Redundancy
Co-learning spaces, Personalized Chatbots, Cyber Cafes, tie up with Coaching Houses
