Engineering is about Products:

1. We created a really complicated product by human collaboration, ingenuity -> in that process we created some knowledge -> You can now study that for further future innovations.
2. Attend a 4-year school cause we are so stupid to directly solve that problem again with you in a top-down manner.
3. What you are taught may be basic, unimportant cause who has the time to update it, most of the great things we use are hidden from the public.
4. Although, if you are smart enough cause the information is now flowing at a fast pace, classes will be boring and meaningless for you.
