State-sanctioned executions are little more than public theatre that risk celebrating and perpetuating violence at the expense of the ‘rule of law.’ As heinous as these crimes were, the imposition of the death penalty — the deterrent effect of which has been widely debunked — does nothing to improve the lives of women

Best Research : Answering fundamental questions, Making those long horizon connections, finding interdisciplinary hidden or invisible Knowledge graph Patterns
Verification should aggravate connections + novelty reward

One of the core issues the nation suffers is lack of information. People don’t know their rights, government policies that apply to them, access government’s schemes and being able to complain about them. We can solve this with technology.

Let’s say we build something call the India phone - designed for poor households across the country. It should Aadhar based authentication and UPI inbuilt. And based on their Aadhar data, it has to bring up apps that fit their needs:

Illiteracy: If the person is illiterate, then download literacy app in their mother tongue that makes learning basic alphabets fun and easy. Government could easily fund such apps in many languages.
Unemployment: Jobs app to find work real time if the person is looking for work. Again, government could build a LinkedIn/Naukari designed for the wage workers - and enable a quick application with authenticated information of their skill sets. All you have to do is look at a factory job, see the location and if interested, one click apply. This could break a big bottleneck in employment generation.
Farm crisis: Provide them contextual tips on what to grow their land, when to grow and how to grow. Again using GPS data, number crunching from the remote sensing satellites and pricing information from the futures markets. A farmer should be able to have the phone in his land and based on the GPS data, it should be able to say barley is best grown there, where to obtain the seeds and how to take care of it.
Middle man: When the farmer sells a produce, he/she should be able to take a pic of the produce and have an app as simple as OLX/Quikr to put it up for sale. Customers should be able to directly find and pick up that produce.
Hunger: Connect to local public distribution system and alert recipients when their ration rice, wheat, dal or oil is ready to pick up. If a person didn’t receive food, there must be a direct way to escalate to the top.
Infant mortality: If the person is an expectant mother - show them video tips on taking care of the fetus. When it is time it has to help them find the adequate medical care.
Corruption: Apply to government schemes directly from the phone and file complaint from the phone. When intended recipients access the schemes there is lesser room for corruption. Put up all the analytics in public domain for everyone in the country to understand how many people benefit from each public scheme.
Crime: If there is a crime, you should not even need to visit a police station, but just click the file FIR button. Same for any kind of accidents or reporting about broken roads, unreliable power etc. Women should not especially feel intimidated about visiting a police station to file a crime report and should be able to do from the comfort of their phone. Again, we should be able to track the status of each file like we do with our Amazon packages.
And these apps have to be loaded based on the citizen’s information collected through various means and not have to depend on the citizen downloading a particular information.

Then use blockchain to track whether the recipients really received the benefits from the subsidy. Subsidies should be given in the form of tokens that are passed to local government offices and eventually to farmers, students etc. With blockchain now you know where a particular token is and whether someone has siphoned it off.

We have to leapfrog and completely move our governance with a range of well thoughtout apps with a simultaneous push for 100% smartphones, data access and power slots in all public places to charge these phones.
