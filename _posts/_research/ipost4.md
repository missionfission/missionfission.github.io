Need for Effective Collaboration Strategies to accelerate scientific research - progressive people coming together.
Science is about creation, review and understanding of knowledge. It should be taught as such.  
Initial capital investment on open-source projects
Effective Inter-disciplinary research collaboration strategies.
Lessons from innovation: innovative best people coming together have created wonders. example: OpenAI, Deepmind, Bell Labs.
Financially Independence to small group of innovative people have produced the best impact. Mostly driven the extreme passion for innovation and automation.
Universities and Industrial Research can only sustain a small number of researchers. To a achieve a cambrian explosion of research a new model of acceleration is required.
How to make it work ? Create a virtualization layer : A layer of new system over the existing slow system
Industrial mostly related to business products, company's agenda, cross-domain collaboration difficult.
Startups model. Good research initiatives taken by google, facebook awesome things. Number of posts still severely limited. MOOCs have done one job of cheap online knowledge distribution.
Free Model of knowledge creation.
Still extensive room for worldwide online innovation and open review systems.
Blockchain method for upholding scientific integrity and method. Code review systems and reproductibiltiy.
Open Review system of method and results. Taking the development process of a scientist online via online dissemination of knowledge and training for creation of knowledge.
